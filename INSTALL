		Lne installation

Normally you can just do "make" followed by "make install", and that
will install the lne files in /usr/ directory (add 'PREFIX=path' 
variable for other install directory). If need the release version, 
add 'RELEASE=y' variable. 

	$ make RELEASE=y ;# as yourself
	# make install ;# as root

When you link you programme, you need link the pthread library.

If you use MSVC, you need create config-os.h for youself. the 
config-os.h only need one line '#define LNE_WIN32'.
